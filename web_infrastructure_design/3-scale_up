Server Architecture with Load Balancing
Server
Main entry point for user requests.
It can be a DNS or a redirection point to the Load Balancers.

Load Balancer (HAProxy)
Two HAProxy load balancers are configured in an active/passive or active/active cluster (depending on the setup).
Their role is to distribute incoming traffic to downstream servers.

Web Server & Application Server
The Load Balancers route requests to:

A Web Server (for static content or simple HTTP request handling),

An Application Server (handles business logic and dynamic processing).
Each component runs on its own dedicated server.

Database
The database is accessed by both the web server and the application server.
It is also hosted on a separate server to ensure isolation and performance.
