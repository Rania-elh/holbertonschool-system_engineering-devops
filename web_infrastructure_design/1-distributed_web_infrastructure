This diagram illustrates a high availability architecture for a web application, using a load balancer and a master-slave database replication setup across two servers.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Load Balancer (HAProxy) :

At the top, there's a load balancer, specifically HAProxy.
Its job is to distribute incoming network traffic between multiple servers to balance the load, improve availability, and prevent overload

2. Two Servers :

Below the load balancer, there are two servers.
Each server includes:
Web server (Nginx): handles HTTP requests.
Application: the core business logic or backend of your web service.
Database: stores your application data.

3. Master and Slave :

The left server is labeled as the Master server. It holds the primary database where most write operations (insert, update, delete) are performed
The right server is the Slave server, containing a replica of the master database. It's generally used for read operations to reduce the load on the master.

4. How It Works :

Users access the application through the load balancer.
HAProxy distributes traffic between the two servers (e.g., round-robin or based on current load).
If the master server fails, the slave can be promoted to take over (either manually or through failover mechanisms).

5. Advantages :

High availability: If one server goes down, the other keeps running.
Scalability: Load is shared between servers.
Separation of duties: Reads can go to the slave; writes go to the master.
