Server:
  - Web server: Nginx
  - Application server: Handles business logic
  - Application files: Your app code
  - Database: MySQL

Domain:
  - foobar.com is the main domain
  - www.foobar.com is a subdomain with a DNS A record pointing to 8.8.8.8

Data flow:
  User -> HTTP request -> Nginx -> Application server -> Database -> Response

Definitions:
- A server is a computer that provides data/services to clients over a network.
- The domain name maps human-readable names (foobar.com) to an IP address.
- A DNS 'A' record maps the subdomain 'www' to the IP address of the server.
- The web server (Nginx) receives HTTP requests and forwards them to the app server.
- The application server processes requests, runs the app logic.
- The database stores and retrieves persistent data for the application.
- The server communicates with the user's browser via HTTP over TCP/IP.

Issues:
- SPOF (Single Point of Failure): one server for all roles.
- Downtime during maintenance (e.g., restarting Nginx or updating code).
- Cannot handle high traffic â€“ no scalability (no load balancing or replication).
