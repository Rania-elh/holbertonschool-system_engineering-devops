1. DNS Resolution
The user requests access to a domain (www.foo.bar).
The request is first handled by a local DNS server, then forwarded to an external DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8 â€“ Google DNS) for resolution.

2. Secure Access
After DNS resolution, the connection passes through an SSL certificate to establish a secure HTTPS session.
Then the request travels through the Internet to the internal infrastructure.

3. Load Balancing
The request reaches a Load Balancer, powered by HAProxy, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to balance the load and ensure high availability.

4. Server-Side Processing
There are three backend servers (Server 1, Server 2, Server 3), and each one contains:

Web/Nginx: Handles web traffic (HTTP/S).

App: The application layer where business logic is executed.

MySQL: The database engine for data storage.

Each server is protected by a firewall, which restricts unauthorized access and secures the internal environment.

5. Monitoring
Each server is connected to monitoring clients, which are responsible for tracking the health, performance, and availability of the components.
